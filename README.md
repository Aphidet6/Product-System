# Product System

This repo contains a minimal Product Management system.

- Backend: Express REST API in `server/` (stores data in `server/products.json`).
- Frontend: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind in `client/`.

Features implemented:
- Search products by name or product number
- CRUD endpoints (create, read, update, delete)
- Home page with search bar and result list
- Product detail page with image, name, description

See `server/README.md` and `client/README.md` for setup.
